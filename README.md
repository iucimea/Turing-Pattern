Reaction-diffusion systems are continuous ﬁeld models whose equations are made of only reaction terms and diffusion terms, as shown below:



Reaction terms ( Ri(...) ) describe only local dynamics, without any spatial derivatives involved. 
Diffusion terms ( Di∇2fi ) are limited to the Laplacian of the state variable itself. 


The clear separation between non-spatial and spatial dynamics makes the modeling and simulation tasks easy, 
but despite the simplicity of their mathematical form, reaction-diffusion systems can show strikingly rich, 
complex spatio-temporal dynamics.
